# 🎯 Click Ads Prediction  
### Machine Learning & Deep Learning Models for Predicting User Click Behavior

The **Click Ads Prediction** project builds a complete end-to-end machine learning system that predicts whether a user will click on an online advertisement. Through exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model experimentation—including classical ML models and transformer-based deep learning—the project demonstrates how predictive modeling can increase ad targeting accuracy, reduce wasted impressions, and boost digital marketing ROI.


## 🧩 Problem Overview  
Online advertising generates billions of impressions daily, but only a small percentage lead to clicks. Predicting click-through behavior gives marketers the ability to:

- Target the right users  
- Optimize ad spend  
- Personalize recommendations  
- Improve campaign performance in real time  

This project uses user behavior, demographics, and engagement patterns to train ML and DL models capable of classifying whether a user is likely to click an ad.


## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project includes a complete EDA workflow:
- Distribution of user features  
- Correlation analysis  
- Click vs. non-click behavioral patterns   
- Data balancing and preprocessing  
- Feature importance plots  

These insights help identify the strongest predictors of click behavior and guide the modeling phase.


## 🧠 Modeling Approach

The system compares several models:

### **🔹 Traditional ML Models**
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  
- Decision Tree
- Ada Boost  

These provide baseline performance and interpretability.

### **🔹 Deep Learning / Transformer-Based Models**
A transformer-based neural network is implemented to capture deeper patterns from encoded input features—useful for high-dimensional or non-linear relationships in user behavior data.

### **🔹 Training & Evaluation**
Models are evaluated on:
- **Accuracy**
- **F1-score**
- **ROC-AUC**
- **Precision/Recall**

The best model is selected based on predictive performance and generalization capability.
